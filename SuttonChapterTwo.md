Exercise 2.1

In ε-greedy action selection, for the case of two actions and ε = 0.5, 
what is the probability that the greedy action is selected?

Ans:

Probability that the action converges to greater than 1-ε that is, to near certainity. 
		
		1- ε = 0.5
		1 action converges at 0.5
		2 actions converges at 0.5*0.5 = 0.25 (assuming that actions are independent of each other)
